                        <h4>My background spans Sustainable Food Systems and Technology. I have a keen interest in the role of technologies in promoting equality and diversity in socio-technical systems.</h4>

                    <h3>Current Position</h3>
                    <p>In February 2022, I began learning Full-stack Web Development on the <a href="scs-scheme.html">Netmatters Scion Coalition Scheme</a> (SCS). My interests are in understanding how technologies can enable a transition to a sustainable and equitable food system, and how the technology sector can redress structural inequalities in society. I have experience working within the technology sector, first in a business support role at <a href="https://limber.work/">limber.</a> and subsequently as project lead for a sustainable farming initiative at <a href="https://www.cookpadteam.com/">Cookpad.</a></p>
                    
                    <p>Having spent the past year and a half working within the food and farming sector, whilst self-studying topics such as technology ethics, regenerative business design, and equality and diversity in technology, I wish to return to working within technology development. I decided to approach this by training in software development for a number reasons: to improve my understanding of the technical aspects of coding, to gain practical skills I could apply in my own learning, and to improve the quality of my conversations with software developers. Having worked within technology companies before, but without an intimate knowledge of how technologies are built, I felt that increasing my understanding of coding and the software development process would improve my ability to collaborate with developers.</p>
                        
                    <p>On completion of the SCS course, I hope to find work with a technology company that is actively engaging with the issues of sustainability, climate change, and diversity and equality in technology and society.</p>

                    <h3>Education and Qualifications</h3>
                    <p>I studied pre-clinical veterinary science for 3 years at the University of Bristol, before transferring onto the BSc in animal behaviour and welfare, which I graduated from in 2016 with a 1st class honours.</p>
                    <p>I have a further 7 months' experience in higher education, as a PhD student studying sustainable agricultural sciences at Rothamsted Research and the University of Bristol. I left academia to explore alternative career paths.</p>
