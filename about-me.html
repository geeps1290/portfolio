                    <h3>Food Systems and Sustainable Agriculture</h3>
                    <p>I studied Veterinary Science at the University of Bristol, with the intention of qualifying as a Farm Animal Vet. However, my interests evolved to encompass the Food System as a whole; having been exposed to the agricutural sector through Veterinary placements on farms, I became interested in the wider dynamics of the food system and the implications of these for environmental sustainability, animal welfare, and farmer wellbeing. Deciding to pursue this interest, I left Veterinary Science after my third year, transferring to a BSc in Animal Behaviour and Welfare, from which I graduated with a 1st class honours in 2016.</p>
                    <p>I spent the following two years exploring avenues into a career engaging with the issues of food systems and climate change, alongside working full-time. I briefly returned to academia, to begin a PhD in Sustainable Livestock Sciences, before exiting the academic world once more in order to explore other career options.</p>

                    <h3>Technology</h3>
                    <p>In 2018, I began working in a small technology start-up in Bristol, <a href="https://limber.work/">limber.</a>, which ran a digital platform for flexible shift work in the hospitality sector. This was my first experience within the Technology Sector, and I immediately became interested in the technology development process, as well as the wider ethical implications of decision-making within technology companies and the scale of these companies' impact. During this time, my awareness of systemic inequalities in the Technology Sector and wider society increased, and I began to educate myself about gender inequality and racism.</p>
                    <p>Growing ever more conscious of the impacts of climate change and ecosystem degradation, I left <a href="https://limber.work/">limber.</a> in 2019, to return my attention to Sustainable Food Systems. I now had an additional area of interest, however: the role and ethics of technologies in Food Systems transition. Following a brief stint working freelance with environmenal campaigners, I landed a job marrying these two passions, taking on the role of Project Lead on a sustainable farming project with <a href="https://www.cookpadteam.com/">Cookpad</a>. This role allowed me to further develop my dual interests of technology and sustainable food systems. I left Cookpad in October 2020 in order to gain further experience from on the ground in the food system itself.</p>

                    <h3>Current Position</h3>
                    <p>In February 2022, I began learning Full-stack development on the <a href="/scs-scheme.html">Netmatters Scion Coalition Scheme</a>. My interest remains in understanding how technologies can enable a transition to a sustainable and just food system, and how the technology sector can redress structural inequalities in society. Having spent the past year and a half working within the food and farming sector, whilst self-studying topics such as Technology Ethics, Regenerative Business Design, and Equality and Diversity in Tech, I wish to return to working within Technology Deveopment. I decided to approach this by training in Software Development for a number reasons; to improve my understanding of the technical aspects of coding, to gain practical skills I could apply in my own learning, and to improve the quality of my conversations with Software Developers. Having worked within tech companies, but without an intimate understanding of how technologies are built, I felt that increasing my knowledge of coding and the software development process would improve my ability to collaborate with developers. On completion of the SCS course, I hope to find work with a tech company that is actively engaging with the issues of sustainable food systems, and/or diversity and equality in technology and society.</p>
